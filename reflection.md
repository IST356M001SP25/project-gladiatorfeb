# Reflection

## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to build a complete data pipeline from scratch. I learned how to:
- Interact with APIs using `requests`
- Store data locally and organize it for a larger project
- Transform and clean data using `pandas`
- Build interactive visualizations with `plotly`
- Create a user-friendly dashboard with `streamlit`
- Write modular code and simple unit tests

## Challenges

The biggest challenge I faced was getting the API to work properly. I initially used the TMDb API but ran into issues with the API key configuration. I switched to the OMDb API, which worked better, but still had trouble getting the script to run due to key setup errors.

Another challenge was managing file paths and making sure data moved smoothly between scripts. Sometimes the CSVs wouldn't generate or would be in the wrong location, causing later steps to break.

## What I Would Improve

If I had more time, I would:
- Add error handling and fallback methods when API calls fail
- Include more visualizations like genre counts or rating histograms
- Let users search for their own movie titles in the dashboard
- Deploy the Streamlit app so it could be accessed online

## Final Thoughts

Even though my project had some technical issues during runtime, I completed every major step with intention. I learned a lot about data pipelines and how to build something end-to-end. I feel more confident in using APIs, writing modular Python code, and building dashboards.
